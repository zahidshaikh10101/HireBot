- **extract\_text\_from\_pdf(pdf\_file):** Extracts text content from a given PDF file by reading its bytes and using a text extraction function.
- **extract\_contact\_number\_from\_resume(text):** Uses regex to identify and extract a contact number from the resume text.
- **extract\_email\_from\_resume(text):** Uses regex to identify and extract an email address from the resume text.
- **extract\_name(resume\_text):** Uses the spaCy NLP library and pattern matching to extract a full name (first, middle, and last names) from the resume text.
- **extract\_degree\_name(resume\_text):** Uses a generative AI model to extract the degree name from the resume text, ensuring that the current degree appears first.
- **extract\_college\_name(resume\_text):** Uses a generative AI model to extract the college/university name from the resume text.
- **extract\_company\_name(resume\_text):** Uses a generative AI model to identify company names and their corresponding years of experience from the resume text.
- **extract\_total\_experience(resume\_text):** Uses a generative AI model to calculate the total years of experience by summing up the experience across multiple companies.
- **extract\_strength(resume\_text):** Identifies four key strengths from the resume text using Google Generative AI.

- **extract\_social(resume\_text):** Extracts LinkedIn and GitHub profile links from the resume text using regex.

### Match Percentage Calculation:

- **extract\_match\_percentage(resume\_text, job\_description):** Uses a weighted scoring system to determine how well a resume matches a job description based on four criteria: skills, experience, education, and keywords.

#### Weighted Function Breakdown:

Match Percentage is computed as:

```
Match Percentage = (Skills Score √ó 0.40) + (Experience Score √ó 0.30) + (Education Score √ó 0.15) + (Keywords Score √ó 0.15)
```

- **Skills (40%)**: Exact skill matches score highest, related skills score lower.
- **Experience (30%)**: More years of experience get higher scores.
- **Education (15%)**: Full match gets full points; related degrees get partial points.
- **Keywords (15%)**: Important job description keywords are matched against the resume.

This ensures that skills and experience have the most weight, while education and keyword relevance contribute to the final match percentage.

## Job Search Feature

A Streamlit web app feature that allows users to upload a resume (PDF), extract job-related details (role, experience, skills), and search for matching job postings via an API.

### How It Works:

1. **Resume Upload & Extraction:**

   - User uploads a PDF resume.
   - The function `extract_resume_information_job_search()` extracts job-related details.

2. **User Input Fields:**

   - Extracted job role is auto-filled in a text box.
   - Users enter preferred location and select employment type (Full-time, Part-time, Intern, Contractor).
   - Job postings can be filtered by date posted (Today, Week, Month).
   - Skills are extracted from the resume and displayed using `st_tags`.

3. **Job Search via API:**

   - Upon submission, an API request is sent to `jobs-api14.p.rapidapi.com`.
   - Filters include job role, location, employment type, and date posted.
   - The response is parsed, extracting job details (title, company, location, employment type, date posted, job provider).

4. **Displaying Job Listings:**

   - Results are shown as interactive job cards using HTML and CSS.
   - Each job listing includes a **match percentage** (calculated via `extract_match_percentage()`).
   - Users can expand/collapse the job description.
   - "Apply Now" button directs users to the job application link.

5. **Error Handling & API Limitations:**

   - Displays a message if no jobs are found.
   - A 30-second delay (`time.sleep(30)`) prevents API rate limiting.

### Key Features:

‚úÖ Resume parsing for automated job search input\
‚úÖ API-based job retrieval with filtering options\
‚úÖ Match percentage calculation for better job relevance\
‚úÖ Interactive job cards with "Read More" functionality\
‚úÖ Streamlit UI integration for a seamless user experience
